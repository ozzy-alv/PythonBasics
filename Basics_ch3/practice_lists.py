#exercises to get comfortable with creating and implementing basic lists

#exercise, create a list of your friends names

friends = ['Bryam', 'Bella', 'Coco', 'Kiki']

print(friends[0])
print(friends[1])
print(friends[2])
print(friends[3])

#now with the list of friends print a message to them, each message should be the same

#creating a unique variable for each friend
message_one = "Welcome, " + friends[0] + " everyone has been dying to meet you. Please make yourself at home."
message_two = "Welcome, " + friends[1] + " everyone has been dying to meet you. Please make yourself at home."
message_three = "Welcome, " + friends[2] + " everyone has been dying to meet you. Please make yourself at home."
message_four = "Welcome, " + friends[3] + " everyone has been dying to meet you. Please make yourself at home."

#printing the messages
print(message_one)
print(message_two)
print(message_three)
print(message_four)
