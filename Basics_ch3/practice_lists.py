#exercise, create a list of your friends names

friends = ['Bryam', 'Bella', 'Coco', 'Kiki']

print(friends[0])
print(friends[1])
print(friends[2])
print(friends[3])

#now with the list of friends print a message to them, each message should be the same

message = "Welcome, " + friends[0] + " everyone has been dying to meet you. Please make yourself at home."

print(message)
