This is the start of my journey into learning how to write effective programs.
Python basics is a repository for the basic section in the book called Python crash course.
In summary, I start by learning the methods and functions of Python and practice each concept learned chapter by chapter.
Another repository will succeed this one named Python Projects, which will implement everything learned in the first section Python Basics.
